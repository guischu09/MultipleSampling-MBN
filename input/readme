-dataFile: a string with the full path for a .csv file containing the PET (e.g. SUV/SUVr) computed values for each region.
Each row of this matrix contains PET data for a single individual.
While each column contains information about a single ROI.

The column header should be defined as the transpose of the CoordsFilename.
The first element of each row should be defined as the class/group of that individual. 
See folder 'Input' and follow that precise structure to generate your results.
